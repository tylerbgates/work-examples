# work-examples
This repository holds examples of projects from previous positions I've held! Consists of mainly Python code blocks for GIS applications. Specific filenames and pointers have been changed prior to uploading.

A majority of these files were used to process geographic / georeferenced raster and vector data for use in water resource projects. This repository is meant as a showcase of my previous work, and will be updated when new projects are completed.
